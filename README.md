The main idea of this project to form a database of clients. Among the main opportunities of this project are adding, deleting personal information about clients (like: phone, e-mail and so on). For realization this idea I was using the following stack of technologies like: react.js, es6, redux, redux thunk. The working version of this project is available by this link: https://react-redux-ebd64.firebaseapp.com
